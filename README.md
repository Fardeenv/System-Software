# System Software Projects

This repository contains implementations of various system software components and programs related to assemblers, loaders, and linkers. Each project simulates a specific system software function, offering practical insights into low-level programming concepts.

## Project List

| Folder                         | Description                                                                 |
|:------------------------------|:-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Absolute_Loader**            | Loads object code into memory without modifications.                        |
| **Assembler_Pass1_Pass2**      | Two-pass assembler that processes assembly code, creates symbol tables, and generates object code. |
| **EQU**                        | Handles the EQU assembler directive for assigning constant values to symbols. |
| **EQU_Literal**                | Extends assembler functionality to support EQU directives and literals.      |
| **One_Pass_Assembler**         | Processes assembly code and generates object code in a single pass.         |
| **Relocating_Loader**          | Adjusts object code to be loaded at different memory addresses.             |
| **SIC_XE_Assembler_Basic**     | Basic assembler for the SIC/XE architecture.                               |
| **Linking_Loader_Pass1_Pass2** | Links multiple object files and loads them into memory in two passes.       |
| **Literals_Updated**           | Handles literals in assembly code.                                         |

## Prerequisites

- A C compiler (e.g., `gcc`) for projects written in C.
- Basic understanding of system software concepts like assemblers and loaders.
- Git installed to clone the repository.

## How to Run

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/FardeenVaddo/system-software-projects.git
   cd system-software-projects
   ```

2. **Navigate to a project folder**:
   ```bash
   cd Absolute_Loader
   ```

3. **Compile and run the code**:  
   For C programs:
   ```bash
   gcc loader.c -o loader
   ./loader
   ```

4. **Adjust commands based on the programming language or project requirements**  
   (check project-specific READMEs if available).

## Explore Project-Specific Instructions

Some projects may require input files (e.g., sample assembly code). Refer to the individual project folder for details.

## Folder Structure

Each project folder contains:

- Source code files (e.g., `.c`, `.asm`)
- Input files (if required, e.g., sample assembly code)
- A `README.md` (if available) with specific instructions
